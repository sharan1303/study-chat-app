# RAG Implementation Strategy for Study Chat App

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for the uploaded resources in the Study Chat App. The goal is to enable the app to semantically understand uploaded documents, retrieve relevant information based on user queries, and generate more accurate, contextually relevant responses.

## Current System Architecture

The existing system allows users to:

- Create modules for organizing study materials
- Upload resources (files) to these modules
- Chat about these resources

Resources are currently:

- Uploaded to Supabase storage
- Referenced in the database via the `Resource` model
- Not processed for semantic understanding or retrieval

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Resource Processing Pipeline

1. **File Upload Interceptor**

   - Extend the current upload process in `app/api/resources/upload/route.ts`
   - After successful upload to Supabase, trigger document processing

2. **Document Processing Service**

   - Extract text from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
   - Clean and preprocess the text
   - Create chunks of appropriate size for embedding

3. **Embedding Generation**
   - Generate embeddings for each chunk using a suitable embedding model
   - Store embeddings in a vector database for efficient similarity search

### 2. Vector Database Integration

1. **Vector Store Selection**

   - Implement PostgreSQL with pgvector extension (works well with the existing Supabase setup)
   - Benefits: No additional service, integrated with existing database

2. **Schema Extension**

   - Add new models to the Prisma schema:

   ```prisma
   model ResourceChunk {
     id          String   @id @default(uuid())
     resourceId  String
     content     String   @db.Text
     metadata    Json
     embedding   Unsupported("vector(1536)")
     resource    Resource @relation(fields: [resourceId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

     @@index([resourceId])
   }
   ```

3. **Migration Path**
   - Create and run migrations to add the pgvector extension
   - Add the new tables for vector storage

### 3. RAG Query Pipeline

1. **Query Understanding**

   - Process user queries to understand intent and context
   - Generate embeddings for the query

2. **Retrieval System**

   - Perform similarity search against the vector database
   - Retrieve the most relevant document chunks
   - Implement filtering based on module context

3. **Response Generation**
   - Augment the prompt with retrieved document chunks
   - Generate responses using the LLM with provided context
   - Format and present responses with source attribution

### 4. User Interface Integration

1. **Resource Context Awareness**

   - Update the chat interface to show which resources are being used
   - Allow users to explicitly select which resources to include

2. **Citation and References**

   - Show citations to source documents in responses
   - Provide links to the original resources

3. **Feedback Mechanism**
   - Implement user feedback on response quality
   - Use feedback to improve retrieval and generation

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies

- **Text Processing**: `langchain` document loaders and text splitters
- **Embeddings**: `@langchain/openai` or `@langchain/google-genai` (already in dependencies)
- **Vector Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **RAG Pipeline**: `@langchain/core` retrieval and generation components

### New API Endpoints

1. **Process Resource**

   - `/api/resources/process`: Process an uploaded resource and generate embeddings

2. **RAG Chat**
   - `/api/chat/rag`: Chat endpoint that uses the RAG pipeline

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

- Set up pgvector in PostgreSQL
- Create schema modifications and migrations
- Implement text extraction service

### Phase 2: Embedding Generation

- Implement the document processing pipeline
- Create embeddings for uploaded documents
- Store in vector database

### Phase 3: RAG Query System

- Implement retrieval system
- Connect to existing chat functionality
- Create initial user interface updates

### Phase 4: Refinement

- Optimize chunk sizes and embedding parameters
- Implement feedback loop
- Add advanced filtering and relevance tuning

## Considerations

### Performance

- Optimize chunk size for balance between context and relevance
- Implement caching for frequent queries
- Consider batched processing for large documents

### Security

- Ensure embeddings don't leak sensitive information
- Maintain proper access controls to resources and their embeddings

### Scalability

- Design for growing vector databases
- Consider horizontal scaling options for processing pipeline

## Next Steps

1. Create a proof-of-concept implementation
2. Benchmark retrieval quality with test documents
3. Iterate based on retrieval performance
4. Integrate with the production system
