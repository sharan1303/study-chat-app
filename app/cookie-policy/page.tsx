              like web beacons (sometimes called &quot;tracking pixels&quot; or
              &quot;clear gifs&quot;). These are tiny graphics files that

              someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them.
              This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of
              users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or
              communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to
              the website from an online advertisement displayed on a
              third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure
              the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these
              technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so
              declining cookies will impair their functioning.
